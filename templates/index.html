  <p>
    Welcome to Camp Ramah in the Berkshires's leveling system! This program will assign activities as best as it can trying to maximize camper happiness. Please just upload the required 3 files, press submit, and watch as your assigned campers instantly download to your computer! Please note: the program only accepts .xlsx files.
  </p><br />
  There are 3 input files on this page that you need to know about:
  <ol>
    <li>Camper Preferences</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This document takes in the camper's preferences for the coming rotation. Currently, the program expects <b>no more than 6 camper preferences.</b> As currently constructed, there's only one field for "name," so please only include one column with the name rather than a first and last name. Include edah and bunk if you want - if they're there, they'll appear in the output, and if not the output file will have empty columns.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Camper Histories</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This document should contain a camper's name (make sure it matches what was listed for camper preferences!) and all of the past activities that this camper has had, plus the preference of those activities when assigned.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Activities</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This document should contain the name of every activity, the activity's capacity (if unlimited, enter a number equal to or larger than the number of campers being sorted), and either "Yes" or "No" if the activity is reapeatable or not (for example, you may not want to allow campers to repeat mitbachon, or perhaps an activity like biking offers the same program every rotation and therefore a camper would be terribly bored in that activity for a second time).
        </li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
  <br />
  The website also allows you to name the downloaded file. Be sure to enter the name of the file that you want, leaving out the .xlsx ending. <br /><br />

  The algorithm is going to be improved in the coming days, but for now it works as follows: the algorithm seeks to minimize the number of later-preferenced choices as much as possible, while also including a tendency to hand out 2nd and 2nd choices instead of 1st and 3rd choices. It does this by always considering how hard the camper's next preference is to fill, and prioritizes those campers with harder following choices over those with easier following choices. It then looks for opportunities to switch 1st and 3rd, 4th, 5th... choices into 2nd and 2nd. More details available upon request.
